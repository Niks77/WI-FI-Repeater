# WI-FI-Repeater
Convert Your Phone into Wifi Repater Using Http and Socks5 proxy without root

This project use Wi-Fi Direct Technology To simulated Wi-Fi Tethering otherwise it is generally used for  Casting Screen  and File Transfer.

Although We need to acknowledge the fact the Wi-Fi Direct was not made for tethering , thats why we cannot access internet directly thats why we need something kind of proxy
thats why I implemented Http and Socks5 proxy.

I prefer Socks5 Proxy because it can also redirect the udp and tcp connections unlike http proxy which redirect tcp through proxy. Although there is no native support for socks5 proxy on any Operating System
you have to use third party software.

# How to use 
 - ## Http Proxy
    - Use "192.168.49.1" for ip address and 1080 (default) for port.
 - ## Socks5 Proxy
    - Use Software like Proxifier, proxycap , sstap for socks5 
    - Use "192.168.49.1" for ip address and 1083 (default) for port.
 
# TODO
 - Display and Calculate Speed of Each Client
 - Block particular Client
 - Multiple Http And Sock5 Server on Mutiple Ports
 - Support for Udp on ubuntu
